# Rusty Nail POS System

### Created by Stuart Rimel

## Overview
---
Rusty Nail is a GTK4 GUI application that serves as a point of sales (POS) system specifically for operating in bars and restaurants. This application will provide a visual interface for the user to take orders for patrons and add to their tab. This program will also allow users to remove items from a patron's tab as well as create and select among many patrons in the system. When a patrons is "closing out" their tab, the checkout button will generate a mock receipt containing the transaction id, name, total, and credit card details for payment processing. The GUI will dynamically update itself based on user interactions with the program. The main visual component is a grid of buttons system such that on clicking will generate another grid of buttons to select specific items to add to the current patron's tab. Different modal dialogs will present to the user when they create a new tab, select a different patron, and close out the currently selected patron.
