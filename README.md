# Rusty Nail POS System

### Created by Stuart Rimel

A POS application that is made for the use in bars or nightclubs. Features would 
include tracking sales, generating reports, and making transactions. Sales can be 
tracked per clerk, per period (day, week, month, year), and per type (cash, credit 
card). Reports can then be generated from this data. The user (clerk or administrator)
will interface with the system through a TUI or GUI or web application. The main focus 
of the system will be to make transactions efficiently and smoothly within the context 
of a fast-paced bar atmosphere.
